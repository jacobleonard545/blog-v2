## What Is CyberForce?

<a href="https://cyberforce.energy.gov/cyberforce-competition/?">Cyberforce</a> is a cybersecurity competition hosted by the Department of Energy that allow teams to
defend their infrastructure while being attacked.

Teams of 4-6 will have 2-3 weeks to harden their systems and prepare
for several attacks from the red team on the day of the competition. Alongside that, teams are also expected to
host a web server with access to users/resources and provide a functional website for the green team. There are also these
CTF-like challenges known as anomalies which teams can solve throughout the competition day for extra points.
Teams are graded on their defense, usability, documentation, and anomalies which are
tallied up on a scoreboard.

## An Overview of the Competition

The competition begins by giving the login credentials to the team's machines which has been through
Microsoft Azure in the past, but have recently switched to Amazon Web Services (AWS). These
are a combination of Linux/Windows machines that serve a purpose and rely on each other to function during
competition day.

There's also a set of rules/restrictions that dictate what we we're able to do with the machines which
can be a little intimidating as it could lead to disqualification. Don't worry as it's not that complicated; just
don't touch certain machines and don't delete any machines (and don't hack other teams).

Now that teams have access to their machines, there are **3 parts** to focus on during this competition:
**Hardening**, **Usability**, and **Anomalies**.

### Hardening
The scenario is that a number of machines have been compromised, so some of them are not allowed to be touched as this is how red team will perform their
attacks. There are certain machines we will be able to configure (which is great as there's less to worry about)
and we can focus on those. We had about a week to report any vulnerabilities and how we can mitigate them which can
be done with a simple vulnerability scanner using *nmap* or *Nessus*.

We were also given an extra slot (only one in 2022, but multiple in the past years) to spin up another server which is done on purpose. This
is where we implemented an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to monitor any activity of the machines. This is a good
time to research **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** and other IDS tools!

Here are some (not all) notable things to check before/during the attacks:
* Command history of possible compromised/new users in /.bash_history
* Login times (successful and failed attempts) of possible compromised accounts
* Logs of the ssh service
* Keys added to /.ssh/authorized_keys/
* Default passwords anywhere on the machine
* Suspicious files/executables/services/tools on the machines that don't have a direct use of service
* Scans
* Hash Attacks
* Reverse Shell techniques (they love performing these so be wary)

Here are some tools to help you catch these attacks before or as they happen (for detection, not prevention):
* nmap (vulnerability scan for CVEs), Nessus, Snort, Splunk, netstat, tcpdump, wireshark




### Usability
We know about the red team, but what about the green team?

In addition to implementing an IDS on the extra
slot, we also had to host our web server on the same machine. We were given a template to follow what the website
should look like with user information and resources that are fetched from a database. The only things graded
were pretty much whether the website was accessible to the public and followed the template as given.

### Anomalies
Anomalies are Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges that actually make up a good portion of the overall score, so this
part is definitely important. This year, we were given a list of tools needed to solve all of the anomalies so make
sure those are ready by competition day.

## My Experiences

It's most definitely on the intense side as far as competitions go, but I found it to be a great experience once
I understood the premise of everything.

I first did the competition in 2019 when I was still studying to be an electrical engineer (with no
interest in software), so you can imagine how intimidating is was to be handed all these machines
with requirements/restrictions and possible disqualification if we did something wrong.
Not only did I not understand how these machines worked, but I had to secure them as well? Do
I even have time, let alone the skills/knowledge, to take on this competition? These are all questions
I had when I first did it and a big reason for writing this post.

## Run It Back

I will no longer be a student at a University for next year's competition (for now), but
I would definitely be interested as a volunteer in the future. However,
here's what I learned over the years:

### Time
Time is the biggest factor in this competition as there's a lot to do in such a short amount of time.
It's important that you and your team understand the commitment as this competition requires
a good amount of time to be allocated for preparation. We are all students with classes, jobs, and extra-curriculars,
so it's understandable that this competition may not be the highest priority. I would still encourage those
to do it even if that's the case.

### Teams
The two biggest parts of the competition were setting up an IDS with rules that are configured for the
competition and setting up a live website with user accounts that fetch the correct information. Splitting up the work
between these two would be ideal to take on this competition.

## Conclusion
The CyberForce team did a great job overall running this competition and definitely provided
everyone with a valuable experience. The quality of the competition is improved each year and I know
they are working harder to provide a better experience for students. There's a ton to learn and most certainly more
tools and tactics that I continued to look into even after the competition, so definitely check it out
if you get the chance.
