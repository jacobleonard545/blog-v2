## Overview

This post covers a lot of the basics in passwords and how password cracking can occur.
I try and keep it simple, but this is mainly used to outline my presentation for the cybersecurity club.
Enjoy!

## Introduction

It baffles me to this day that the most common passwords really were just
**password** or **12345** according to the LinkedIn database that was breached in 2012.
My favorites are the passwords set by Donald Trump and his administration 
for his Twitter account which were **yourefired** and **maga2020!** 
which happened to be cracked in 2016 and 2020 respectively (think about 
why those times may be problematic).

Password security is often taken for granted by many users because
they often cope by choosing weak, easy to remember passwords as well as reusing old ones. 
This blog will highlight how passwords are cracked and provide insight on how to 
set a secure password.

 

## Hashing

Users send their passwords to a server where it is stored in a database
and stored as plaintext, but was quickly realized that was
quite insecure. So hashing became a thing which takes a plaintext
message and computes a string of the same fixed length no matter how short/long the message. Although more
secure, two popular attacks on hashing exist: Pre-Image Attacks and Collision Attacks.

A **Pre-Image Attack** is when the attacker is given a specific hash value and attempts
to find a source message that hashes to that value. It takes approximately 2<sup>n/2</sup>
attempts where n is the number of bits in the hash digest. A **Collision Attack** is when the attacker finds two separate source messages that both hash
to the same value. The expected number of times it takes to produce two messages with the same
hash value is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the number of bits in the hash digest.

We can see why the hash digest length is important and how hashing algorithms like SHA-1 are
deemed insecure. Hashing algorithms like SHA-256 are used today which returns a hash value of 256-bits.


In addition to choosing a secure hashing algorithm, **salting** was implemented
which just adds a string to the plaintext password before hashing. 
Although this can be improved with protocols such as 
iterative hashing or keyed-hash functions, most companies just use salted hashes.



## Password Cracking

In Linux Operating Systems, passwords were originally stored
in plaintext (*sigh*) in `etc/passwd` where it's readable by anyone. To resolve this, the passwords
were encrypted or hashed in `etc/passwd` but still vulnerable to offline guessing attacks.
As of today, `etc/passwd` contains usernames and is readable by anyone while `etc/shadow` 
contains the encrypted or hashed passwords and is readable only by root.

A system administrator may implement annoying rules to ensure everyone's password is secure, but 
it's better to be safe than sorry.
In order to check the toughness of a password, they will run some password cracking tools.

### Password Cracking Tools

There are really two attacks when it comes to password cracking: **Brute-Force Attack and Dictionary Attack**.
If an attacker got their hands on the shadow file which contained the encrypted/hashed passwords,
then they could use a tool like *John the Ripper* to crack insecure passwords. It's a simple tool that allows for
dictionary attacks on the shadow file and is dependent on the power of the GPU.


To use the default word list (brute-force), run this command:
```
$ john shadow-file
```
To use a specified word list (dictionary attack), run this command:
```
$ john -w=pathname/to/password.lst shadow-file
```
There's a bunch of word lists that are available online, but the most popular one is **rockyou.txt** 
which contains over 14 million passwords. Of course, creating a simple program 
to permute and combine phrases/numbers to create passwords can be just as effective if you know the victim.

*Burp Suite* is another tool that can be used to test web application security and 
even brute force a login page. The tool uses a technique to bypass the login by using a 
simulated login page. Just like *John the Ripper*, a word list can be used to start an attack.

### Phishing

Phishing is the practice of misguiding a victim into entering their confidential credentials through a false
login page. Although not password cracking, it's still a common method for hackers to steal your password. 
The best way to recognize a phishing scam is to check things like the URL and authenticity of the sender. A 
general rule of thumb is to always be cautious when entering your password anywhere and to change it when you 
suspect that you've fallen victim to one.

## Password Managers

When I first heard about password managers, I was told just about any of them will suffice. Password managers
will allow users to keep randomly generated passwords of varying length and characters while
only remembering one password. It's actually normal that people don't know their passwords because their password
manager does everything for them. We've gone over how attacks can be performed and how length is an important
variable. Your password should be unique and not anything related to what you've used in the past.

When choosing one, feel free to do some research as they all have their benefits and drawbacks.
Bitwarden, KeePassXC, 1Password are some of the valid options so it really depends on the user's preference.
My advice is to experiment and see which one fits your needs the best before committing to one. Be sure
to check for usability as this is something you will use almost every day.

## How Do I Set A Strong Password?

My advice would be to use a password manager where you'll only need to remember one password. After understanding
how password cracking works, we can finally assess how to create a secure password. Websites will usually tell you to 
add special characters and numbers, but that isn't exactly the best thing to tell people in my opinion. When you think about it,
people will just reuse old passwords and add an exclamation point at the end and deem it secure enough.  

The best (and most realistic) practice when setting a password is to utilize **word combinations**. Think of the most outlandish, out-of-pocket
combination of words or even sentence and make sure it's at least 15 characters long. To make it even more secure, implement the
*Bruce Schneier Method* which transforms a sentence using a rule. 

For example, we can use the first two letters of each word in:

***"The Tennessee Volunteers Football Team Will Do Well This Year"***

and make our password this:

***"ThTeVoFoTeWiDoWeThYe" ***

Remember, a sentence so out-of-pocket like this will surely do the trick! But in all seriousness,
special characters like one exclamation point won't make your password more secure. The combination of words and length are the important
variables when deciding a password which is how we can both easily remember them and prevent hackers from cracking your password
