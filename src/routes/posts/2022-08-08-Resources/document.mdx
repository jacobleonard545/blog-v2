## Introduction

I helped as a board member for the cybersecurity club on my campus where we
teach various topics throughout the year. Looking back, I was always intrigued by the field but
never knew where to start. There are members of the club who are also in that position, so I
figured this would be of help.

## Sources of Information

You've probably heard it before, but the field is *constantly* changing and finding new ways to exploit
and defend. It's always good to keep up to date on what's going on in the world, so finding news sources
is a good way to do that.

Here are some of the sources the board members and I use:
* <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"> Hacker News</a>
* <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/"> Tech Crunch - Zack Whittaker</a>
* <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23cyebrsecurity"> Twitter - #cybersecurity</a>
* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/"> Reddit - r/cybersecurity</a>
* <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts">CISA Alerts</a>

These are just some to get you started, but there are plenty more.

## Certifications

Certifications are big in the cybersecurity field (you've probably seen this <a href="https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/">roadmap</a> before)
and **Security+** is one of the most recognized entry level certification in the industry. In order to
take the exam, it costs upward of four-hundred dollars which is actually one of the cheapest. John did
a great job on a presentation going in-depth to important certifications, but we won't get into that right now.

Professor Messer offers Security+ exam training videos on his <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/">website</a>
and the best part is that they're short, simple, and *free*. I highly recommend checking him out regardless
if you want to take the exam or not. Many will argue whether or not obtaining this is beneficial
to your career (as with many other certifications), but I found that some of the material provides a good foundation to cybersecurity.

I've also had conversations of certifications to learn penetration testing such as **Pentest+**, **CEH**, and **eJPT**.
Companies, especially government and DoD, require certain certifications as a standard and will likely pay for you to take them.
The material is out there for free and some prefer the formal approach with structure when learning, so it definitely doesn't hurt to try if you are not
sure where to start.

## Capture the Flag

Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges are a great way to learn and harness valuable skills in the cybersecurity field.
These are pretty difficult to approach for beginners as most of us are script kiddies.
Watching YouTube videos and learning the tools (nmap, netcat, etc.) needed to solve some of these can be a great
addition to your arsenal.

### Environment

Before getting into CTF challenges, I highly suggest learning about **virtual machines** and the **Unix command-line** in particular.
The Linux community offers an abundance of open-source tools, so familiarizing yourself with these environments will be
beneficial to your journey. Some popular Linux distros to use are Kali Linux and ParrotOS as both provide a collection of tools already
installed (I've seen some use these as their main operating systems... this is not preferred as they aren't as consistently up to date with
security standards).

### "Hacking"

Now that we've set up our environment, we can begin taking on CTF challenges. Some are simple challenges and web-based while others
require you to connect to a machine. Every challenge you encounter will utilize different tools and methods to solve, but they
all generally follow the same approach:

* Reconnaissance - Gathering information about the target (what kind of server, versions, etc.).
* Scanning & Enumeration - Identifying hosts on a network and open ports (sometimes making requests to see what's received).
* Gaining Access - A variety of methods can be used to gain access such as performing a reverse shell.
* Persistence - Once we're in the system, sometimes we need to maintain that access.
* Breadcrumbs - Cover up tracks to prevent suspicion.


### Tools

As mentioned before, there's no point in reinventing the wheel as many of the tools needed already exist.
In my experience, the only times I needed to write my own scripts were when I was brute forcing something which
can be reliant on time (as you progress into tougher challenges, writing your own scripts will be important but I am not there yet).
Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pentesting/comments/9ondj5/a_good_pentesting_tools_list/">list</a> of popular tools with
some I've used often, but googling will always be your best friend when figuring out what to use.

### Platforms

Here's a list of good CTF platforms to begin your journey:

* <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">OverTheWire</a> - A series of levels that get more difficult as you progress.
* <a href="https://exploit.education/protostar/stack-zero/">Exploit</a> - A series of levels that get more difficult as you progress with walkthroughs.
* <a href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a> - Beginner-friendly challenges with hints.
* <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> - Beginner-friendly challenges and lessons with walkthroughs.
* <a href="https://hackthebox.com">HackTheBox</a> - A little more intimidating as you had to solve a challenge
to make an account, but has made efforts to provide a more beginner-friendly environment.

If you want to get a glimpse of what these look like in action, here's some youtubers I enjoy watching:

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w">LiveOverflow</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec">IppSec</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010">John Hammond</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ITSecurityLabs">IT Security Labs</a>

## Miscellaneous

Here's a list of miscellaneous practices/resources/things to know:

* <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> - Offers courses on everything you can imagine such as certification training, practice exams, and more.
* <a href="https://www.cybrary.it">Cybrary</a> - Similar to Udemy and I've heard great things, but never really used it myself.
* <ins>Password Managers</ins> - Something everyone should have in my opinion. Most are good, do your research and find which one suits you.
* <ins>Podcasts</ins> - There are many podcasts out there, but the favorite amongst everyone is DarkNet Diaries.
* <ins>Events</ins> - Attending conferences, hackathons, and meetings are a great way to network. I've found
that I learn more from others than what I teach myself.


## Conclusion

It's a tough field to start since there's no real "entry-level" topics, but I hope this was a good start for those
new to cybersecurity.
