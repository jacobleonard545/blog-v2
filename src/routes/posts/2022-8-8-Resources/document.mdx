## Introduction

I helped as a board member for the cybersecurity club on my campus where we
teach various topics throughout the year. Looking back, I was always intrigued by the field but
never knew where to start. There are members of the club who are also in that position, so I
figured this would be of help.

## News Sources

You've probably heard it before, but the field is *constantly* changing and finding new ways to exploit
and defend. It's always good to keep up to date on what's going on in the world, so finding news sources
is a good way to do that.

Here are some of the sources the board members and I use:
* <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"> Hacker News</a>
* <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/"> Tech Crunch - Zack Whittaker</a>
* <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23cyebrsecurity"> Twitter - #cybersecurity</a>
* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/"> Reddit - r/cybersecurity</a>
* <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts">CISA Alerts</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow">Youtube - LiveOverfllow</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec">Youtube - IppSec (HackTheBox)</a>
* <a href="https://hackutk.org">HackUTK :)</a>

These are just some to get you started, but there are plenty more.

## Professor Messer (Security+)

Certifications are big in the cybersecurity field (you've probably seen this <a href="https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/">roadmap</a> before)
and **Security+** is one of the most recognized entry level certification in the industry. In order to
take the exam, it costs upward of four-hundred dollars which is actually one of the cheapest. John did
a great job on a presentation going in-depth to important certifications, but we won't get into that right now.

Professor Messer offers Security+ exam training videos on his <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/">website</a>
and the best part is that they're short, simple, and *free*. I highly recommend checking him out regardless
if you want to take the exam or not. Many will argue whether or not obtaining this is beneficial
to your career (as with many others), but I found that the material provides a good foundation to cybersecurity.

## Capture the Flag

These are pretty difficult to approach for beginners as most of us are script kiddies.
Watching YouTube videos and learning the tools (nmap, netcat, etc.) needed to solve some of these can be a great
addition to your arsenal.

* <a href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a> - Beginner-friendly challenges with hints.
* <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> - Beginner-friendly challenges and lessons with walkthroughs.
* <a href="https://hackthebox.com">HackTheBox</a> - A little more intimidating as you had to solve a challenge
to make an account, but has made efforts to provide a more beginner-friendly environment.

## Miscellaneous

* <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> - Offers courses on everything you can imagine such as certification training, practice exams, and more.
* <a href="https://www.cybrary.it">Cybrary</a> - Similar to Udemy and I've heard great things, but never really used it myself.
* <ins>Password Managers</ins> - Something everyone should have in my opinion. Most are good, do your research and find which one suites you.
* <ins>Podcasts</ins> - There are many podcasts out there, but the favorite amongst everyone is DarkNet Diaries.
* <ins>Events</ins> - Attending conferences, hackathons, and meetings are a great way to network. I've found
that I learn more from others than what I teach myself.


## Conclusion

It's a tough field to start since there's no real "entry-level" topics, but I hope this was a good start for those
new to cybersecurity.
