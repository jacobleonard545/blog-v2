## Scenario

The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of "binary bombs" on our class machines.
A binary bomb is a... I'm sure you've read the writeup if you're on this page. If you
have no idea what I'm talking about, the Bomb Lab is a popular reverse-engineering
lab used by classes that deduct points for every "mistake" the programmer makes. You can
read a more detailed writeup with a simple Google search.

If you wish to do this on your own, there's a download of the files for this lab
with the notification server disabled <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/labs.html">here</a>.


## Objectives

We are given a bomb with the task to defuse it. Extract the contents of the tar file
and we see the following:
* bomb - The executable binary file
* bomb.c - Code written in C
* README

Let's explore *bomb.c* and see what's in there. After scanning the code, it's clear
that there are six phases with each subsequent phase likely being "saucier".

**GDB**, a GNU debugger, is going to be our best friend when we dissect the binary file so
find yourself a good cheat sheet.

## Phase 1 - GDB

Here are the commands I used when approaching the first phase:

* `$ strings bomb` - Displays the human-readable strings in the binary file.
* `$ gdb bomb` - Loads binary file into GDB.
* `(GDB) $ b phase_1` - Set the breaking point to avoid exploding the bomb.
* `(GDB) $ run` - Runs the program in GDB.
* `(GDB) $ disas` - Disassemble; Displays the lines of assembly.
* `(GDB) $ ni` - Next instruction (good for taking things one step at a time).

Setting breakpoints are crucial for this lab, especially when your grade is on the line.
After setting breakpoints and putting in a test input; we arrive at `phase_1`.

```
Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000400ee0 in phase_1 ()
(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function phase_1:
=> 0x0000000000400ee0 <+0>:	sub    $0x8,%rsp
   0x0000000000400ee4 <+4>:	mov    $0x402400,%esi
   0x0000000000400ee9 <+9>:	call   0x401338 <strings_not_equal>
   0x0000000000400eee <+14>:	   test   %eax,%eax
   0x0000000000400ef0 <+16>:	   je     0x400ef7 <phase_1+23>
   0x0000000000400ef2 <+18>:	   call   0x40143a <explode_bomb>
   0x0000000000400ef7 <+23>:	   add    $0x8,%rsp
   0x0000000000400efb <+27>:	   ret
End of assembler dump.
```

The first thing we notice is the function, `strings_not_equal`. It's safe to
assume that `phase_1` is checking for a string comparison. Right above that line is a
mov command to the %esi register... *very interesting*. Let's see what's in there.

Run `(GDB) $ x /20c 0x402400` and we get the following output:
```
0x402400:	66 'B'	111 'o'	114 'r'	100 'd'	101 'e'	114 'r'	32 ' '	114 'r'
0x402408:	101 'e'	108 'l'	97 'a'	116 't'	105 'i'	111 'o'	110 'n'	115 's'
0x402410:	32 ' '	119 'w'	105 'i'	116 't'
```
We received an outlandish string that is likely to be our solution to defusing
phase 1. In order to find the full string, we can change the number until it reaches the null character or
check the strings of the binary file to see "Border relations with Canada have never been better."

We can double check and get the following output:
```
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Border relations with Canada have never been better.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
```

## Phase 1 - Ghidra

Modern problems require modern solutions and sometimes that involves making our lives easier.
GDB is a great tool for learning reverse engineering, but the NSA developed Ghidra which is
a more modernized version. Let's play around with it.

After installing Ghidra, I dropped the binary file into the application and it quickly analyzed everything.
The most astonishing part of it all was this piece of code it gave me:

```
void phase_1(undefined8 param_1)

{
  int iVar1;

  iVar1 = strings_not_equal(param_1,"Border relations with Canada have never been better.");
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    explode_bomb();
  }
  return;
}
```
By uploading the file, I was immediately given the solution to `phase_1`.

## Phase 2 - Ghidra

Alright, let's try it out with `phase_2`. Here's the decompiled code given to me:

```
void phase_2(undefined8 param_1)

{
  int *piVar1;
  int local_38 [6];
  int local_20 [4];

  read_six_numbers(param_1,local_38);
  if (local_38[0] != 1) {
    explode_bomb();
  }
  piVar1 = local_38 + 1;
  do {
    if (*piVar1 != piVar1[-1] * 2) {
      explode_bomb();
    }
    piVar1 = piVar1 + 1;
  } while (piVar1 != local_20);
  return;
}
```

There are six numbers and we know the first one must be **1**. A variable is
assigned the sum of the first number and 1 which would be 2. Then there seems
to be a formula to calculate the remaining numbers. The do-while loop looks to check
if the next number is doubled from the previous, so our solution could be:
**1 2 4 8 16 32**

Check it and sure enough, we get this output:

```
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Border relations with Canada have never been better.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
1 2 4 8 16 32
That's number 2.  Keep going!
```

## Conclusion

I completed this lab entirely with GDB since I was likely to be tested on it in class, but
Ghidra was a **game changer** to say the least. I highly suggest understanding GDB and even doing as
much of this lab with it before switching over.

Another interesting part of this lab was how easily we could disable the notification of the bomb
blowing up by deleting parts of the binary file. Again, I didn't do this but it's certainly something that is possible.
