Hi, Jacob Here!

I'm currently studying computer science and have a profound interest
in **frontend development**, **infrastructure**, **cybersecurity**, and **everything 
in between**. My interests outside of study include just about anything, but
to name a few: I enjoy activities related to **fitness**, **photography**, 
and **video games**!

I started this blog to write about my learning experiences 
in whatever interests me at the moment. Most of the time, my posts
will pertain to technologies/tools and exploits that are explained simply and sometimes
more in depth. It helps
me understand the concept and hopefully provides you with a better insight on the
subject.

Feel free to chat with me about any of these topics if you see me.
