Hi, Jacob Here!

I'm currently studying computer science and have a profound interest
in **software development**, **cybersecurity**, and **everything
in between**. I started this blog to write about my learning experiences
in whatever interests me at the moment. It helps me understand
the concept and hopefully provides you with a better insight on the
subject.

Feel free to chat with me about any of these topics if you see me.
